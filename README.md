# DecisionSupportSystem

### Intro
P12 - Decision Support System: 	
Decision making in any field can be a complex and difficult activity and this is especially so with many forms of financial data. The aim of this project is to develop a “hybrid” decision support system – that performs automated analysis, whilst also keeping a “human in the loop”. In order to achieve this, data acquisition, filtering, statistical analysis, graphical visualisation and user interaction need to be combined effectively together into a coherent system.	

This is a Software Engineering project that requires students to bring their own data analysis domain (an area of financial decision making that interests them in particular). Successful students will be competent programmers wishing to gain experience of data APIs and graphical visualisation frameworks.

### Structure

The submission deadline for the Project Plan is 13:00 on Monday 3rd July 2023.

The Project Plan (PP) document should be submitted as PDF, and should contain the following:

**Title**: It should show the draft title for your MSc thesis, your name, and the name(s) of your supervisor(s). 

**Abstract**: a paragraph or two that briefly outlines the motivation of your work, what you will do, and a "fairy tale" outcome of what you hope to find. 

**Ethics statement**: a short statement - one sentence - confirming you have discussed ethics with your supervisor and either there is no ethics approval required, the project is covered by the blanket ethics, or the project will need to apply for ethics approval (for details on ethics, see "Project Ethics" in side menu). [Title + Abstract + Ethics statement: 1 page total]

**Project plan**: two pages of coherent text (i.e., of the form you intend to write for your thesis, not rough notes) that could be used as the opening pages of your Introduction/Overview chapter (Chapter 1 of your thesis). [2 pages]

**Literature review**: It should include four pages of coherent text forming an initial survey/summary of relevant literature, that could be used as the basis of your Contextual Background or Literature Review chapter (typically Chapter 2 and/or 3 of your thesis). [4 pages]

**Bibliography/References**: that lists all the literature sources cited in your literature survey, consistently formatted in a commonly-used style (such as APA or IEEE), and with each item in the References being complete, i.e. as you would format it in your final submitted thesis.

**Appendix**: 
Include a one-page time-plan for your project, which you may choose to format as a week-by-week bullet-list, or possibly as a Gantt Chart. [1 page]

Include a one-page risk assessment for your project, talking about the major risks you can foresee that might plausibly occur and interfere with your plans. For each risk, state clearly what it is, what its likelihood is, what its effects/impact would be on the project, and what your intended mitigation or risk-reduction involves. [1 page]
